# collagenerator
Use circular permutation approach to solve and visualize chiral assemblies of collagen trimers (DRAFT)

## Documentation

1. Use `generate-nonredundant-trimers.py` to solve and generate list of chiral trimer assemblies.
2. Take output and inject it into one the `simple*` scripts in the Processing folder

### Extras
sketch_arc_midpoint.py - calculate and generate arc midpoint
